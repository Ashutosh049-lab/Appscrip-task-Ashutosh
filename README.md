## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Custom)
- Fetch API
- Netlify Hosting

---

## 🔧 API & Data Source

Used **FakeStore API** for stable JSON data  
👉 https://fakestoreapi.com/products

📌 Reason for switch:  
The original assignment API lacked fields needed for:
- Sorting by price
- Category filters
- Detailed view

FakeStore provided consistent fields (title, price, category, image, description).
